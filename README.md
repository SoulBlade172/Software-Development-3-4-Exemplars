# Software-Development-3-4-Exemplars
## The work in this repository applies to the 2020-2024 study design (given its similarities, the study design used from 2016-2019 also mostly applies to the work here, although not completely)

This repository hosts the work of SoulBlade172 (me) and @45rfew. All of the work I did for my SAT is housed here as well as 45rfew's, as well as their SAC work. Although the SATs and SACs may differ between schools, the overall nature of the assessments should remain the same. Through the creation of this repository, 45rfew and I hope to provide students of Software Development assistance in understanding what is expected of the subject and guide students to being able to achieve the best marks they can. 
**This repository is not a study guide for the subject, so please do not expect things like study tips and notes. For that, please visit vcedata.com (planned to be shutdown by the end of 2024)**

If you are looking for coding and programming examples, please refer to 45rfew's work. Although the coding within their work is generally more complicated than what the average student can produce (nor is it expected by the subject and does not necessarily provide extra marks), it is better coded than my work.

Feel free to download and view the work as you wish and use it for whatever educational reasons you deem necessary, **however directly copying the work is strictly discouraged. If you get found out by your teacher that you have copied someone's work, then you could receive severe ramifications.**

**Marks and study scores:**
SoulBlade172:
-  SAT 1 - Criterias 1-5 received marks from 9-10 (out of 10)
-  SAT 2 - Very High (~87%, I was unable to get the scores for each criterion. Crtieria 6 is most likely the lowest scored)
-  Study score - 43 (raw)/42 (scaled)

45rfew:
-  SAC 1 - 93%
-  SAT 1 - 94%
-  SAT 2 - 96%
-  Study score - 42 (raw)/41 (scaled)

The both of us received A+ for all components of the subject.
